 - Engineered a C++ static reflection library enabling automatic interfacing
   of C++ applications with Python and Matlab, facilitating seamless
   integration and enhancing cross-platform functionality.

 - Developed a cutting-edge modeling and simulation abstraction system
   alongside a declarative domain-specific language (DSL) for partial
   differential equations (PDEs) and stencil computations, utilizing
   [[https://clang.llvm.org/][Clang/LLVM]] and [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]].

 - Pioneered software solutions for simulating turbidity currents,
   significantly advancing understanding of process stratigraphy.

 - Created a novel vectorization strategy that resolved the contention
   between the vectorization and data locality, markedly improving
   computational efficiency.

 - Led comprehensive analysis and optimization of proprietary seismic
   imaging and inversion software, enhancing the utilization of the
   HPC systems.
