Collaborated within a multidisciplinary team on the creation of a
comprehensive multi-physics solver, designed to accurately simulate
large-scale casting processes. This involved integrating various
physical models to predict the complex interactions during casting,
enhancing predictive capabilities and simulation fidelity.

Conducted innovative research aimed at eliminating grid-induced
anisotropy, ensuring more accurate and reliable simulations. This work
involved developing and testing novel algorithms to mitigate the
effects of grid orientation on simulation outcomes.

Cooperated in research efforts to significantly reduce numerically
induced spurious currents, particularly those arising from the
numerical treatment of fluid interfaces. This was achieved through the
formulation and application of advanced numerical methods, enhancing
the solver's ability to capture the dynamics of fluid interfaces with
high fidelity.
