Collaborated with the University of California, Irvine, and Idaho
National Laboratory on pioneering spray-based strip casting process
development. Contributions included:

 - Advanced 2D and 3D flow solvers for heat transfer and
   solidification.

 - Analytical model for oblique droplet impact and a Lagrangian spray
   model.

 - Molecular dynamics simulations for contact line dynamics research.

This effort enhanced predictive modeling and understanding of the
strip casting process.
