* Professional Summary

I am a computational scientist and engineering software developer primarily
focused on performance critical software across the low-latency,
high-performance and high-throughput domains.  My decades of experience
straddling the divide between research and software development
provide me with a unique ability to takle problems that span that
devide while still being able to effectively handle problems on either
side, especially when combined with an in-depth knowledge and
experience in numerical analysis, which is often at the core of those
problems.
