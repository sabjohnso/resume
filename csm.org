In collaboration with the University of California, Irvine, and Idaho
National Laboratory, developed advanced analytical and numerical
models to innovate a spray-based strip casting process. This
interdisciplinary project encompassed:

 - Design and implementation of two and three-dimensional interfacial
   flow solvers, incorporating complex phenomena such as heat transfer
   and phase change (solidification), to accurately simulate the strip
   casting process.

 - Development of an analytical model for oblique droplet impact,
   enhancing understanding of droplet behavior and interactions during
   the spray process.

 - Creation of a comprehensive Lagrangian spray model to predict and
   analyze the distribution and behavior of spray droplets in the
   strip casting environment.

 - Conducting molecular dynamics simulations to explore contact line
   dynamics, providing insights into molecular-level interactions and
   effects on the casting process.

This work contributed significantly to the field of materials
engineering by advancing the capabilities for simulating and
understanding the spray-based strip casting process, with potential
implications for manufacturing efficiency and enhanced material
properties.
