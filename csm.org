Creation of analytical and numerical models in support of the
development of a spray based strip casting process in partnership with
the University of California, Irvine and the Idaho National
Laboratory, including two and three-dimensional interfacial flow
solvers with heat transfer and phase change (solidification), an
analytical model for oblique droplet impact, a Lagrangian spray model,
and molecular dynamics simulation for the investigation of contact
line dynamics.
